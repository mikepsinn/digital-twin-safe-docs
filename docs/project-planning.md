# Project Planning Phases

This proposal outlines the scope, deliverables, and estimated costs for planning and documenting the development of a personal data pipeline for individuals to aggregate their data from various sources (e.g., Gmail, Fitbit, Amazon).

## Phase 1: Research & Assessment

* Research Existing Open-Source Projects: Evaluate potential platforms like OpenPDS, nOSQL, or Apache NiFi for feasibility and alignment with client's vision.
* Feasibility Analysis for Building from Scratch: Assess technical complexities, resource requirements, and development timelines for building a custom pipeline.
* User Research: Conduct surveys and interviews with potential users to understand their data management needs and expectations.
* Landscape Analysis: Analyze existing personal data management solutions to identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for differentiation.
* Define Project Goals & Scope: Formulate clear and measurable project goals, user personas, and acceptance criteria.
* Develop Initial Architecture: Outline potential architectures for the pipeline, considering data sources, ingestion methods, transformation options, and storage solutions.

### Deliverables:

* Research report on existing open-source projects and their suitability.
* Feasibility analysis report with recommendations on building from scratch vs. utilizing existing platforms.
* User research findings report summarizing user needs and expectations.
* Landscape analysis report identifying key projects and integration opportunities.
* Project scope document outlining goals, user personas, and acceptance criteria.
* Draft architecture diagram illustrating high-level data flow and components.


## Phase 2: Architecture & Technology Stack

* Refine Architecture: Based on research and user needs, finalize the pipeline architecture with detailed data flow diagrams and component specifications.
* Technology Stack Selection: Identify optimal programming languages, frameworks, and tools for building and maintaining the pipeline based on chosen architecture.
* Security & Privacy Design: Define data security and privacy protocols, including encryption strategies, access controls, and user consent mechanisms.

### Deliverables:

* Detailed architecture diagrams with data flow, component descriptions, and interactions.
* Technology stack report outlining recommended languages, frameworks, and tools.
* Security & privacy design document detailing data protection strategies.


## Phase 3: Documentation & Presentations

* Product Documentation: Develop comprehensive documentation covering features, technical specifications, usage instructions, and future roadmap.
* Product Presentation: Create compelling presentations for stakeholders and donors, showcasing the vision, value proposition, and development roadmap.
* Issue Tracking & Dependencies: Set up an issue tracking system (e.g., Jira) to define tasks, assign responsibilities, estimate costs, and manage dependencies for efficient project execution.

### Deliverables:

* Comprehensive product documentation including features, technical specifications, usage instructions, and future roadmap.
* Donor and stakeholder presentations with compelling visuals and key information.
* Established an issue tracking system with defined tasks, assigned responsibilities, cost estimates, and dependencies.
